Housed in a Victorian warehouse in Cable Street, East London. Laña sound studio was founded in 2010 by Sergio Lopez and Virginia Pontiveros.

The studio is the result of a big passion for live music and influence of the roots reggae sound of the 70´s.

Perfect place for musicians and producers in need of a place to record, produce a song and mix it with full analogue equipment. We also convert your tracks from MIDI to real analogue sound.
